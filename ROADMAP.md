# Dioxus Motion - Simple Animation Roadmap If i dont get bored?

# Dioxus Motion - Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Core Animation Primitives

### Animate Component

- [x] Basic value transitions
  ```rust
  // Already implemented via:
  Motion::new(0.0)
      .to(100.0)
      .duration(Duration::from_millis(300))
  ```
- [x] Duration control
- [x] Easing functions
- [x] Common animation properties
  - [x] x, y (transform)
  - [x] scale
  - [x] rotate
  - [x] opacity

### Basic Transitions

- [x] Duration (implemented via `duration()`)
- [x] Easing functions (implemented via `easing()`)
- [x] Animation completion callbacks
- [x] Delay
- [x] Spring animations

## Phase 2: Animation State & Control

### State Management

- [x] Animation state tracking (Idle, Running, Completed)
- [x] Progress tracking
- [x] Running state detection

### Controls

- [x] Start animation -> Will always start from the initial value
- [x] Stop -> Will stop on the stopped value
- [x] Resume -> Will continue from the stopped value
- [x] Reset animation -> Will reset back to initial value

## Current Implementation Strengths

- ✅ Solid foundation for value animations
- ✅ Cross-platform support (Web/Desktop)
- ✅ Clean API design
- ✅ Good state management
- ✅ Performance consideration (frame rate control)

## Success Goals

- Simple, intuitive API
- Smooth animations
- Small bundle size
- Easy to understand documentation
- Basic but powerful feature set
